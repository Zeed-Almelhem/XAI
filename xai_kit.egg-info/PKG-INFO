## Overview

The XAI (eXplainable Artificial Intelligence) Library is a powerful toolkit designed to empower data scientists and machine learning practitioners in their journey to understand, interpret, and visualize complex machine learning models. In an era of advanced AI algorithms, transparency and interpretability are paramount. XAI addresses these needs by offering a suite of advanced visualizations tailored for regression analysis, curated datasets, pre-trained regression models, and comprehensive documentation.

## Features

- **Advanced Visualizations**: Explore a rich collection of visualizations in the [XAI Regression Visualizations Module](xai/regression/visualizations/__init__.py) designed to unravel the intricacies of your regression models.
- **Datasets and Models**: Access curated datasets and pre-trained regression models to streamline your regression analysis process.
- **Model-Agnostic Explanations**: Enjoy model-agnostic explanations for compatibility with a wide array of machine learning models.
- **Interpretability for Diverse Data Types**: XAI is built to cater to diverse data types, including tabular data, image data, and natural language processing (NLP) models.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Expect regular updates with additional features and support for various machine learning tasks.
