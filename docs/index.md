# Welcome to the XAI Library Documentation

The eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) Library is your comprehensive toolkit for enhancing model interpretability and transparency in the world of artificial intelligence. Whether you're a data scientist, machine learning practitioner, or just curious about how AI models work, this library provides valuable resources to understand, explain, and visualize complex models.

## Getting Started

- **Installation**: Learn how to install the XAI Library and its dependencies in your Python environment.

- **Tutorials**: Dive into practical tutorials that demonstrate how to use various features of the library.

## Features

Explore the rich features of the XAI Library:

- **Regression Analysis**: Perform in-depth regression analysis with advanced visualizations, metrics, and pre-trained models.

- **Classification Analysis**: Enhance your classification model interpretability with powerful tools and visualizations.

- **Unsupervised Learning**: Gain insights from unsupervised learning models using explainability techniques.

- **Reinforcement Learning**: Improve transparency in reinforcement learning models.
