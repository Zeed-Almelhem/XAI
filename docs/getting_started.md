The eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) library was born out of the need to provide a comprehensive toolkit for data scientists and machine learning practitioners. We recognized the challenge of understanding, interpreting, and visualizing complex machine learning models, especially when it comes to explaining their predictions. This library aims to address the pressing problem of model interpretability and transparency.

Our initial research involved a thorough examination of existing libraries and tools in the domain of machine learning explainability. While there are valuable resources available, we saw the opportunity to create a unique and cohesive solution that offers more advanced visualizations, pre-processed datasets, and pre-trained models. This distinctive approach sets the XAI library apart from other options in the field.

Our primary objective with the XAI library is to enhance the understanding of machine learning models across different domains and use cases. We recognize that AI models have become integral to decision-making processes in various industries, but their opacity can be a significant barrier to trust and adoption.

The scope of our library is broad, as we aim to cover a wide range of AI model types and data modalities. While the first version of the library focuses on supervised learning with a specific emphasis on regression analysis, we have plans to expand its capabilities in future releases. This expansion will include support for classification tasks, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning (RL), and more.

In the coming releases, we envision the XAI library evolving into a versatile and indispensable resource for data scientists and AI practitioners. Some of our future developments include:

- **Model-Agnostic Explanations**: Extending the library to provide model-agnostic explanations, ensuring compatibility with a wide array of machine learning models.

- **Interpretability for Diverse Data Types**: Expanding our toolkit to cater to diverse data types, including tabular data, image data, and natural language processing (NLP) models.

- **Advanced Visualizations**: Continuously improving and adding advanced visualization techniques to help users gain deeper insights into model behavior.

- **Integration with Popular Frameworks**: Offering seamless integration with popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.

- **Interactive Dashboards**: Developing interactive dashboards that allow users to explore model predictions and explanations in real-time.

We are committed to the ongoing development and enhancement of the XAI library to make it a valuable asset in the ever-evolving field of artificial intelligence. We invite you to join us on this journey toward making AI more transparent, interpretable, and accessible to all.

Welcome to the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) library, version 1.0! This initial release is designed to empower your regression analysis by providing powerful visualizations, pre-processed datasets, and pre-trained regression models. In this guide, we'll walk you through the key features and how to get started with the XAI library.

### Regression Visualizations

In the `regression/visualizations` module, you'll find a rich collection of advanced visualizations tailored specifically for regression analysis. These visualizations serve as essential tools for gaining deeper insights into your regression models, evaluating their performance, and interpreting their behavior. Here's a brief overview of the available visualizations:

- **Two-Column Scatter Plot (`create_two_column_scatter_plot`)**: Create scatter plots to explore relationships between two columns in your dataset.

- **Interactive Scatter Plot (`create_interactive_scatter_plot`)**: Generate interactive scatter plots with customizable features, allowing you to interactively explore data patterns.

- **3D Scatter Plot (`create_3d_scatter_plot`)**: Visualize complex relationships by creating three-dimensional scatter plots to study the interactions between three variables.

- **3D Scatter Dashboard (`create_3d_scatter_dashboard`)**: Develop interactive 3D scatter plot dashboards for comprehensive exploration of multivariate relationships.

- **Residual Plots (`create_residual_plots`)**: Construct residual plots to assess model performance, identify patterns, and detect potential issues like heteroscedasticity.

- **Feature Importance Plot (`create_feature_importance_plot`)**: Visualize the importance of features in your regression models, allowing you to understand which factors significantly affect predictions.

- **Actual vs. Predicted Distribution (`create_actual_vs_predicted_distribution`)**: Compare the distributions of actual and predicted values, helping you evaluate model accuracy and biases.

- **Quantile-Quantile (QQ) Plot (`create_qq_plot`)**: Generate quantile-quantile plots to assess data distribution and model fit, supporting your understanding of data normality.

- **Regression Metrics Visualization (`visualize_regression_metrics`)**: Visualize standard regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), RÂ² (R-squared), and more.

- **Advanced Regression Metrics (`visualize_advanced_regression_metrics`)**: Explore advanced metrics including Mean Bias Deviation (MBD), Coefficient of Determination (COD), Explained Variance Score, Fraction of Explained Variance (FEV), Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE), and even custom loss functions tailored to your specific objectives.

- **Residual Plot with Shapley Values (`residual_plot_with_shapley`)**: Combine residual plots with Shapley values to understand how individual features contribute to prediction errors, aiding in feature importance analysis.

- **Error Heatmap by Feature (`create_error_heatmap`)**: Create error heatmaps to visualize how prediction errors vary across different feature combinations, helping you identify which feature combinations lead to larger errors.

### Datasets and Models

As part of this release, we've included carefully curated datasets and pre-trained regression models to streamline your regression analysis process. These resources are designed to help you get started quickly, experiment with various regression techniques, and evaluate their performance.

**Datasets Available:**

1. **Admission Prediction**: A dataset for predicting university admission chances based on academic and personal attributes.

2. **Bike Sharing Demand**: A dataset containing historical bike rental data, suitable for predicting future bike rental demand.

**Pre-trained Regression Models:**

You'll find pre-trained models for various regression techniques, including:

1. **Linear Regression**: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression.

2. **Lasso Regression**: Linear regression with L1 regularization (lasso regression).
